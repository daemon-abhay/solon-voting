Helios Voting Installation HowTo
================================

We intend to use Helios as a backend to provide the secure e-voting 
funcitonality. The installation instructions at 
http://documentation.heliosvoting.org/install are unfortunately a bit
outdated. (It's been a while since Ubuntu 10.04 and latest versions of 
some of the python modules needed don't really easy_install so easily
anymore on such an old Ubuntu...)

Updated and working installation instructions have been writte by Stephane at 
https://github.com/glondu/helios-server/blob/wip/QUICKSTART.md

Note that if you use Vagrant/Virtualbox, you of course don't need to do the
qemu/kvm steps.
